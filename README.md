# CSE590Sp2018
The github repo for CSE590 - Ubiquitous Computing Spring 2018

## Lectures
The class was broken into roughly five modules:
* L01: Introduction to ubicomp and Android
* L02-L04: Signal processing and machine learning in ubicomp systems
* L05-L06: Physical computing (Arduino, circuits, sensors, actuators)
* L07-L08: Computer vision in ubicomp systems
* L09-L10: Fabrication

You can view the lectures [here](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/CSE590Sp2018/tree/master/LectureSlides).

## Code
Any directory prefixed by L0X is a code directory that hosts in-class exercises and other example code for that specific lecture. For example, here's a description of some of the L01 code.

### L01-InClassHelloWorld
The "Hello World" program that we developed in class, which demonstrates how to hook up a button and interact between declarative XML and Java for UI programming.

### L01-ReadAndVisAccel
Demonstrates how to utilize Android's Motion Sensors, how to smooth sensor data using a simple moving average filter, and how to build a custom View.

### L01-RealtimeGraphViewDemo
Demonstrates how to visualize real-time data in [Graph View](http://www.android-graphview.org/). To use the Graph View library in your own projects, simply add "compile 'com.jjoe64:graphview:4.2.1'" to your build.gradle file under your app directory and Android Studio takes care of the rest. See GraphView's [Getting Started](http://www.android-graphview.org/download-getting-started/) page.
